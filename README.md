#CPSVspawn

An extension for MediaWiki responsible for the background spawning of all the necessary CPSV2.0 class pages in the diadikasies.gr platform for registering public sector services.

Currently the configuration of the extension does not occur from within the extension.json file, but from within cpsv.php. Due to be fixed.
